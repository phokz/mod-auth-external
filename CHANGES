v1.2.0   (Josef Liska & Micah Andersen - Nov 22, 2024)
------------------------------------------------------
 * Fix compatibility issues with modern unix auth services, such as sssd,
   due to optimizations for large directories (e.g. LDAP) removing the
   complete group membership list (grmem). Thanks to Joakim Tjernlund.
 * NOTE: builds across all platforms now *require* libbsd or the equivalent
   bsd-standard group function support.
 * macOS build support, with the latest homebrew-core libbsd update.
 * Added cross-platform makefiles (macOS & linux only; Windows does not have
   UNIX groups, so not supported). Thanks to Micah Andersen/BIMI.
 * GitHub Actions build testing on linux & macOS. Thanks to Micah Andersen/BIMI.
 * Copyright information was consolidated in CONTRIBUTORS for consistency.

v1.1.0   (Jan Wolter - Oct 6, 2011)
-----------------------------------
 * Revised to work as an access control provider in Apache 2.4.
 * Eliminated "AuthzUnixgroup on" directive because it is no longer needed.
 * Eliminated "AuthnzUnixgroupError 403" directive because it is supplanted
   by "AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure On".
 * Eliminated "AuthzUnixgroupAuthoritative off" directive because the whole
   concept of authoritativeness is dead for access control providers in
   Apache 2.4.
 * Spelling fixes (as seen on lintian.debian.org). Thanks to klemens/ka7.

v1.0.3   (Jan Wolter - Oct 6, 2011)
------------------------------------
 * Allow group names to be quoted, so that you can have group names with
   spaces in them.  This change was suggested by David Homborg.
 * Document updated with references to versions for Apache 2.4.

v1.0.2   (Jan Wolter - May 21, 2009)
------------------------------------
 * Adding copyright and Apache Version 2.0 license in LICENSE and NOTICE
   files.
 * New directive:  AuthzUnixgroupError, can be used to specify the HTTP
   error number to be returned on failure.

v1.0.1   (Jan Wolter - Aug 6, 2008)
------------------------------------
 * Delete various logging statements that were really just there for
   debugging and should have been removed sooner.

 * If there is an '@' in the user's login name, strip off that and anything
   after it.  An '@' sign is never legal in an unix login name, and some
   authentication modules, like mod_auth_kerb, append an "@domain" to the
   user's login name.

   Both of the above modifications are inspired by patches made by Ken Lalonde
   <ken at globalremit dot com>.

 * Included "http_request.h" header file to suppress a harmless compile-time
   warning.

v1.0.0   (Jan Wolter - Feb 19, 2006)
------------------------------------
 * Original release
