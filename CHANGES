v1.0.2   (Jan Wolter - May 21, 2009)
------------------------------------
 * Adding copyright and Apache Version 2.0 license in LICENSE and NOTICE
   files.
 * New directive:  AuthzUnixgroupError, can be used to specify the HTTP
   error number to be returned on failure.

v1.0.1   (Jan Wolter - Aug 6, 2008)
------------------------------------
 * Delete various logging statements that were really just there for
   debugging and should have been removed sooner.

 * If there is an '@' in the user's login name, strip off that and anything
   after it.  An '@' sign is never legal in an unix login name, and some
   authentication modules, like mod_auth_kerb, append an "@domain" to the
   user's login name.

   Both of the above modifications are inspired by patches made by Ken Lalonde
   <ken at globalremit dot com>.

 * Included "http_request.h" header file to surpress a harmless compile-time
   warning.

v1.0.0   (Jan Wolter - Feb 19, 2006)
------------------------------------
 * Original release
