v3.3.3   (Josef Liska & Micah Andersen - July 22, 2019)
----------------------------------------------
 * Added METHOD environment variable to retrieve the HTTP request method 
   (e.g. GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, etc.). Thanks to Vijay from Google Code.
 * Fixed a bug with incorrect parenthesis grouping when checking the result
   of the external process in exec_external(). Thanks to @dcb314.
 * Added the "GroupExternalAuthNCheck Off" directive to disable the check
   for a previously authenticated user when using *only* the group 
   authorization module. If you use *any* user authentication module in the
   same context, this may be undesirable. Thanks to Micah Andersen/BIMI.
 * Fix launching external processes on Windows - many programs require the
   %SystemRoot% environment variable to function properly. Thanks to Micah
   Andersen/BIMI.

v3.3.2   (Jan Wolter - Dec 12, 2013)
----------------------------------------------
 * Replaced reference to remote_ip field of the connection record with
   useragent_ip, due to the elimination of remote_ip in Apache 2.4.1. Thanks
   to davidsansome and cjwatson for pointing out the need for this.
 * Fixed a bug with setting of GROUP environment variable. Thanks to
   ddarbyson for reporting this, and Guoan Hu for posting the fix.
 * Added test/test.pipe.php, a PHP version of test/test.pipe contributed
   by Claus Andersen.
 * Spelling fixes (as seen on lintian.debian.org). Thanks to klemens/ka7.
 * Fixed Windows build by defining out Unix-specific signal code. Thanks
   to Michal Pokorny <agentydragon@gmail.com>.

v3.3.1   (Jan Wolter - Oct 12, 2011)
----------------------------------------------
 * Deleted most of the sample authenticators from the distribution. They
   are mostly old and crufty or available elsewhere. No need to clutter
   the main distribution with them.
 * Added code to support caching authentications with mod_authn_socache.
   This is enabled by the "AuthExternalProvideCache On" directive.  This
   feature should be considered experimental, since mod_authn_socache still
   seems buggy and it's interface may not have been finalized.

v3.3.0   (Jan Wolter - Oct 6, 2011)
----------------------------------------------
 * Revised to work with Apache 2.3 / 2.4.  Will not work with previous Apache
   versions.
 * Deleted 'GroupExternalAuthoritative' and 'AuthzExternalAuthoritative'
   directives which are obsolete.
 * Deleted 'GroupExternalError' directive which is superseded by Apache's
   'AuthzSendForbiddenOnFailure' directive.

v3.2.6   (Jan Wolter - Oct 6, 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Modified parsing of "Require groups" line so that you can have group
   names that include spaces by enclosing them in quotes.  This change
   suggested by David Homborg.
 * Default action of Makefile changed to "build" not "install".
 * Corrected an exploitable SQL injection flaw in the sample mysql
   authenticator.
 * Add references to version 3.3.x to documentation.

v3.2.5   (Jan Wolter - Oct 29, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Fixed a bug introduced in 3.2.0 in which data for checkpassword-type
   authenticators is written to the authenticator's stdin instead of stderr.

v3.2.4   (Jan Wolter - May 20, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Dropped the radius code from the distribution, because of possible problems
   with it's license.  Thanks to Hai Zaar for pointing out this problem.
 * Modified AuthExternal directive to be able to take more than one
   authenticator name.  If more than one is defined, then each authenticator
   is run in turn, until one succeeds or all have failed.  Probably a similar
   change should be made to GroupExternal, but it hasn't been done yet because
   it's a more complex change and nobody has asked for it.  Thanks to Andreas
   Ntaflos for suggesting this change.
 * Inserted code to restore SIGCHLD to default before running the
   authenticator.  Sometime other modules (like php built with the
   --enable-sigchild option) leave SIGCHLD messed up, which would cause
   problems with getting the return code back from authenticators.  We
   restore SIGCHLD to whatever state it was in originally after the
   authenticator terminates.  Thanks to Stefan Mehlhorn for reporting this
   problem and providing the help needed to diagnose it.
 * Clean-up of handling of return codes from apr_proc_wait() to be more
   formally correct.

v3.2.3   (Jan Wolter - Feb 26, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Added GroupExternalError directive, which allows you to specify the
   HTTP error code to be returned if the group access check fails.
   Default is 401, but you may want to return 403 if you want to show the
   user an error page instead of asking him to login again.  Thanks to
   Peter Crawshaw <pcrawshaw@mta.ca> for this patch.
 * In hopes of getting to a more consistently named set of directives,
   added new aliases for two old directives:
      GroupExternalAuthoritative    alias for    AuthzExternalAuthoritative
      GroupExternalManyAtOnce       alias for    AuthExternalGroupsAtOnce
   Documentation updated to refer primarily to the new names.

v3.2.2   (Jan Wolter - Dec 1, 2008)
-----------------------------------------------
 THIS RELEASE UPDATES DOCUMENTATION ONLY!
 * Improved documentation of AuthExternalContext directive in the INSTALL
   file.
 * Added documentation to the UPGRADE file on interactions between multiple
   Require directives.

v3.2.1   (Jan Wolter - Jul 31, 2008)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Added AuthExternalContext directive, which defines a string that will be
   passed to the authenticator in the CONTEXT environment variable.  This can
   be set from the .htaccess file or the <Directory> block to give slightly
   different behavior from the same authenticator in different directories.
   Thanks to Olivier Thauvin <nanardon at mandriva dot org> for this patch.

v3.2.0   (Jan Wolter - Jan 7, 2007)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Rewrite external authenticator launching code to use Apache's cross-OS
   process/thread library instead of directly calling Unix functions.
   Theoretically this should get us much closer to being usable on non-
   Unix platforms.
 * Support alternate syntax for configuration, using DefineAuthExternal and
   DefineAuthGroup commands.
 * More detailed error logging.
 * Much cleanup of documentation.

v3.1.0   (Jan Wolter - Feb 17, 2006)
-----------------------------------------------
 * New authn/authz version for Apache 2.2.
 * Renamed from "mod_auth_external" to "mod_authnz_external" to agree
   with new module naming conventions.
 * The more secure "pipe" method is now the default, instead of the old
   insecure "environment" method.
 * Eliminated "AuthExternalAuthoritative" directive.  Instead use
   "AuthBasicAuthoritative" for authentication and "AuthzExternalAuthoritative"
   for access control.
 * Substantially rewritten to function as an authentication provider for
   mod_auth_basic instead of a stand-alone authentication module.
 * Eliminated duplication of documentation inside mod_authnz_external.c file.
 * Addition of UPGRADE document, and update of all other documentation.
 * Normalization of many variable names and other clean up of code.

v2.2.10  (Jan Wolter - Sep 29, 2005)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Renamed module from "external_auth_module" to "auth_external_module".  This
   seems to be what is wanted for static linking.

v2.2.9  (Jan Wolter - Sep 25, 2004)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Small corrections to 2.0 defines, thanks to Guenter Knauf <gk@gknw.de>.
 * Pwauth removed from this package.  It is now distributed separately.

v2.2.8  (Jan Wolter - Jun 30, 2004)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Trivial documentation improvement.
 * Clarification of docomentation on use of pwauth options UNIX_LASTLOG,
   FAILLOG_JFH, and MIN_UNIX_UID with PAM.

v2.2.7  (Jan Wolter - Oct 23, 2003)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Pwauth gains IGNORE_CASE and DOMAIN_AWARE options, both aimed at making
   work more easily for those used to authentication in Microsoft environments.
   Thanks to Peter Eggimann <egp@zhwin.ch> for these enhancemen
 * Fix one bit of remaining Apache 1.3 api inside HARDCODE block.
 * Grammar corrections in AUTHENTICATORS file.

v2.2.6  (Jan Wolter - Aug 14, 2003)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Minor improvements to debugging notes in the INSTALL document.

v2.2.5  (Jan Wolter - Jul 11, 2003)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Pass local hostname (or virtual hostname) to authenticator in HTTP_HOST
   environment variable.  Thanks to Steve Horan <sjh-mae@horan.net.au> for
   submitting this modification.

v2.2.4  (Jan Wolter - Jan 12, 2003)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Documentation updates for OpenBSD and minor OpenBSD portability fixes to
   pwauth.

v2.2.3  (Jan Wolter - Oct 21, 2002)
-----------------------------------------------
 * More update of installation instructions.  Thanks to Sven Koch
   <haegar@sdinet.de> and Joshua Polterock <joshuap@sdsc.edu>.

v2.2.2  (Jan Wolter - Oct 14, 2002)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Partial update of installation instructions.

v2.2.1  (Jan Wolter - Jun 24, 2002)
-----------------------------------------------
 * Corrected undefined symbol in _HARDCODE_ option.  Thanks to Phil
   Benchoff <benchoff@vt.edu>.

v2.2.0  (Dave Woolaway, Sven Koch & Jan Wolter - Jun 22, 2002)
--------------------------------------------------------------
 * Ported to work with Apache 2.0.28 by Dave Woolaway <dave@watersheep.org>
 * Independently ported to work with Apache 2.0.39 by Sven Koch
   <haegar@sdinet.de>
 * Version merger and insufficient documentation updates by Jan Wolter.

v2.1.15 (Jan Wolter - Jan 22, 2002)
-----------------------------------
 * Added MySQL-auth to distribution.  Contributed by Anders Nordby
   <anders@fix.no>.

v2.1.14 (Jan Wolter - Jan 1, 2002)
-----------------------------------
 * Minor clarification to documentation on virtual hosts.
 * Minor update of description of pwauth in README file.
 * Correction of AIX compilation instructions.  Thanks to Mathieu Legare
   <legare@uqtr.ca> for this.
 * Fixed name of GROUP environment variable in pwauth/unixgroup script.  Thanks
   to Jeroen Roodnat <jroodnat@xs4all.nl> for pointing this out.

v2.1.13 (Jan Wolter - Jul 31, 2001)
-----------------------------------
 * Pass AUTHTYPE environment variable to external authenticator.  This is
   PASS if we are doing password authentication, GROUP if we are doing group
   authentication, so the same authentication program can easily be used to
   do both.  Thanks to Dan Thibadeau <dan_thibadeau@hp.com> for this.
 * pwauth can now be configured to work for more than one UID.
 * pwauth/FORM_AUTH updated to discuss suExec.

v2.1.12 (Jan Wolter - Jul 9, 2001)
-----------------------------------
 * Fixed erroneous variable names in _HARDCODE_ stuff.  Thanks to Phil
   Benchoff <benchoff@vt.edu> for this fix.
 * Added pwauth/unixgroup, a simple perl unix group authenticator.  Hope to
   replace this with a better solution someday.

v2.1.11 (Jan Wolter - Apr 25, 2001)
-----------------------------------
 * Arguments may now be specified for authenticators on the AddAuthExternal
   command.  The whole command must be in quotes, no shell meta characters
   may be used, and there is a limit of 32 arguments.
 * Support for the checkpassword protocol, allowing use of checkpassword
   compatible authenticators.  Thanks go to Matthew Kirkwood
   <matthew@dev.sportingbet.com> for submitting patches for this.
 * Mod_auth_external now passes the URI environment variable to all
   authenticators, giving the URL of the requested page minus hostname,
   and CGI arguments.  Thanks to Charles Clancy <mgrtcc@cs.rose-hulman.edu>
   and Niall Daley <niall@neoworks.com> for independently submitting similar
   patches for this.
 * Fixed a possible buffer overflow problem in the HARDCODE section.  This
   is unlikely to have been an exploitable security problem but could
   cause a crash in rare circumstances. Thanks go to Bradley S. Huffman
   <hip@a.cs.okstate.edu> for pointing this out.
 * Example programs in test directory log command-line arguments.

v2.1.10 (Jan Wolter - Jan 9, 2001)
----------------------------------
 * Fix a pwauth bug that could cause segmentation faults when compiled with
   the ENV_METHOD option.
 * Add documentation on how to use pwauth for form authentication.
 * Clarify documentation on configuration for SSL servers.

v2.1.9 (Jan Wolter - Jul 7, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * Correct documentation to reflect the fact that Solaris *does* have a ps
   command that displays environment variables.  Thanks to Piotr Klaban
   <makler@oryl.man.torun.pl> for pointing this out.

v2.1.8 (Jan Wolter - May 3, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * By default, pass all group names at once to group authenticators.  To get
   old one-group-at-a-time behavior back, use the new directive
   "AuthExternalGroupsAtOnce off".  This modification contributed by
   Rudi Heitbaum <rudi@darx.com>.  Thanks.

v2.1.7 (Jan Wolter - Apr 3, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * Pass COOKIE environment variable to authenticator with cookies from current
   request.  Is this a good idea?
 * Added rather dubious HP-UX support to pwauth.  Untested.

v2.1.6 (Jan Wolter - Mar 23, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * Added documentation about installing as a dynamically loaded module.
 * Added documentation about "AddModule" command for RedHat installs.
 * Lots of other small documentation improvements.

v2.1.5 (Jan Wolter - Jan  6, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * Improved documentation on writing authenticators.

v2.1.4 (Jan Wolter - Jan  4, 2000)
----------------------------------
 * Oops, PAM support in v2.1.3 didn't work after all.  Many fixes, including
   Work-around for Solaris 2.6 appdata_ptr=NULL bug.  Huge thanks again to
   Peter Arnold <PJArnold@uq.net.au> for help with testing.
 * Generate compile-time error if Apache version is older than 1.3.1
 * Better code to get lastlog path for pwauth.

v2.1.3 (Jan Wolter - Dec 17, 1999)
----------------------------------
 * AuthExternalAuthoritative directive added.  This code contributed by Mike
   Burns (burns@cac.psu.edu).
 * Testing of PAM support in pwauth under Solaris 2.6 by Peter Arnold
   <PJArnold@uq.net.au>.
 * Many clarifications to install manual and other documentation.

v2.1.2 beta (Jan Wolter - Jun 28, 1999)
----------------------------------
PAM support and minor bug fixes.  PAM support in pwauth is based on code
contributed by Karyl Stein (xenon313@arbornet.org).  Not been fully tested.

v2.1.1 (Jan Wolter - Mar 10, 1999)
----------------------------------
Various small enhancements making better use of Apache API.

 * Better memory management, eliminating all use of fixed sized arrays.
 * Child process calls ap_cleanup_for_exec() to close any resources (file
   descriptors, etc) left open in the pools.
 * Cleanup of error messages.


v2.1.0 (Jan Wolter - Mar 5, 1999)
---------------------------------
Significant rewrite, rolling in changes from various divergent versions
and a number of bug fixes, and small enhancements. Changes include:

 * Better checking against overflow of various fixed sized arrays.  (There was
   already some protection, so there probably wasn't a big security problem
   here.)
 * Set environment variables in child process, not parent process.  This
   prevents them from being inherited by future spawned children.
 * Check WIFEXITED before acceping WEXITSTATUS.
 * Elimination of memory leak in strdup() calls.
 * Check return code from pipe().
 * Don't close standard output on child process, instead direct it to error
   log file, just like stderr.
 * Don't use system() calls.  Instead do direct execl() for faster launch
   and better security.
 * In pipe method, the "user=" and "pass=" tags are no longer given on the
   login and password line.
 * Pipe method is supported for group authenticators as well as user
   authenticators.
 * ip-address and host-name are made available to authenticator in IP and HOST
   environment variables.
 * Updated and expanded comments up front.


v2.0.1 (Tyler Allison)
----------------------
I received a patch update to mod_auth_external v2.0 that supposedly fixes some
pipe related bugs.  I do not have a program that uses pipes so I can not test
it myself. I have included the original v2.0 with no patch applied that you
should use if you run into problems and you DO NOT need pipe support.
